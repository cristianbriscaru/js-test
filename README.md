JavaScript Practical Test

1) API is a basic Node.js/Express application using Mongoose connected to a MongoDB database that can be spinned up 
using docker-compose up -d in the api dir

2) WEB is a basic React application, it uses react-router, redux-toolkit and axios

Have a browse of the code! You'll see we already have quite a few things setup.

Please complete the following tasks. Don't rush! Quality is more important that quantity :)

- Login 
- Display the authenticated user name in the AppBar
- Protect 'users' routes to be accesible only by authenticated users
- Maintain authentication using access/refresh tokens
- Display all registered users in Users page (ID, Name and Email)
- Edit a user in a new Edit User page
- Logout
